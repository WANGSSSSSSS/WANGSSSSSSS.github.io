### I' m wangshuai

I am wangshuai from nwpu, major in computer science and technology. During the last three years, i have participated in some robotics competitions so that  i have developed a great interest in artificial intelligence not just because these methods can facilitate the efficiency and  the robust of robot system but the approximate idea impress me a lot. From the low level task such that image processing to the high level question such as motion planning or the environment perception. i keep a fundamental acknowledgement that the approximate method is reliable than exact solution so i believe the artificial intelligence will make a great break through among most areas.
